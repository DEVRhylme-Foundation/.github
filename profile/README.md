# DevRhylme Foundation

**Welcome to DevRhylme Foundation!**  
An AI startup dedicated to advancing **AI technology** with a primary focus on **deep learning, computer vision,** and **open-source AI tools**.


## üåü Vision
Our vision is to push the boundaries of **AI technology**, focusing on creating solutions in computer vision and contributing to the Python ecosystem. Additionally, we aim to integrate **AI** into **Web3 technology**, making decentralized applications (dApps) more accessible for developers and enterprises.

## üíº What We Do
At DevRhylme Foundation, we focus on three main areas:

### 1. Computer Vision
We develop advanced AI models that enable machines to perceive and interpret the world around them. Our projects involve:
- Object detection and tracking
- Image classification and segmentation
- Real-time video analytics
- Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) integration

### 2. Python Libraries
We create and maintain **open-source Python libraries** that simplify AI development. Our key libraries include:
- **VisionPy**: A powerful computer vision library for building applications with minimal code.
- **Web3AI**: A library that simplifies integrating AI models into Web3 and decentralized applications.
- **AIStream**: A data processing library optimized for AI workflows, focusing on speed and ease of use.

### 3. Web3 Technology
We bridge the gap between AI and blockchain by developing frameworks that allow for seamless integration with decentralized systems. Our work focuses on:
- Integrating AI into decentralized applications (dApps)
- Automating processes using smart contracts
- Cross-chain compatibility with platforms like Ethereum and Solana

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Technology Stack
We utilize a modern and comprehensive technology stack, including:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **AI Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Blockchain Platforms**: Ethereum, Solana
- **Web3 Tools**: MetaMask, Truffle

## üîó Get Involved
We are always looking for talented developers, researchers, and visionaries to join us in our mission. If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to our open-source projects or collaborating with us, you can:

- **Check out our GitHub**: [DevRhylme GitHub](https://github.com/DevRhylme)
- **Contact us**: info@devrhylme.org

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
- **Always use the latest version** of our libraries for optimal performance and security.
- For Web3 tools, ensure proper configuration to avoid vulnerabilities.

## üí¨ Community
