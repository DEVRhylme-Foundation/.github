# DevRhylme Foundation

**Welcome to DevRhylme Foundation!**  
DevRhylme Foundation, an AI startup dedicated to advancing **AI technology** with a primary focus on **deep learning, computer vision,** and **open-source AI tools**.


## üåü Vision
We are committed to pushing the boundaries of AI by developing cutting-edge solutions in computer vision and contributing to the growing ecosystem of Python libraries. Our work emphasizes leveraging deep learning to build smarter, more intuitive systems that can understand and interpret the world.

## üíº What We Do
At DevRhylme Foundation, we focus on three main areas:

### 1. Computer Vision
We develop advanced AI models that enable machines to perceive and interpret the world around them. Our projects involve:
- Object detection and tracking
- Image classification and segmentation
- Real-time video analytics
- Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) integration

### 2. Python Libraries
We create and maintain **open-source Python libraries** that simplify AI development. Our key libraries include:
- **VisionPy**: A powerful computer vision library for building applications with minimal code.
- **Web3AI**: A library that simplifies integrating AI models into Web3 and decentralized applications.
- **AIStream**: A data processing library optimized for AI workflows, focusing on speed and ease of use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Technology Stack
We utilize a modern and comprehensive technology stack, including:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **Computer Vision Libraries:** OpenCV, scikit-image, Dlib
- **Machine Learning Tools:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas, Dask
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Hugging Face, spaCy, NLTK
This stack enables us to develop scalable, efficient, and highly performant AI solutions, ensuring seamless integration with various platforms and applications.

## üîó Get Involved
